This project is a little Web Site where you can create, update, delete, and general management your tasks, this project save the data on localStorage only for demo purposes. Before you management your tasks you need create an acount if dont have. The views have a protection if you dont loggin you dont have acces to managed your tasks.

### What do I use in this project?

Vuex (is split in 2 modules): 
    - Auth (Management all authentications, login and register)
    - Task (have logic of CRUD tasks)

And another features of VueJS that i used:
    -Event
    -Components
    -Emit event child to parent
    -props
    -animations transitions
    -Lifecycle methods
    -computed variables
    -vuelidate to validate forms

To design whole page iÂ´m use SCSS i like this css processor because i like the sintax, the wave that i used on the page, i made on getwaves.io.

I enjoyed a lot making this page, because was a fast page to do and like the result. :)
